2. Install prerequisites listed in [README.md](./README.md).
3. Run `npm install` in the project root.
4. Run `npm run tauri dev` to start the app in development mode. Models can be downloaded from the app's built-in downloader, or manually from [huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).
